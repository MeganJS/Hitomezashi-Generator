# Hitomezashi-Generator
A fun pattern-generating C++ project that uses input to create hitomezashi patterns. Inspired by the Numberphile video on [Hitomezashi Stich Patterns](https://youtu.be/JbfhzlMk2eY?si=8HQFi5t2U1n9lt2Y).
Commands: string, random, numbers.
"string" command should be followed by two words or phrases (letters only).
"numbers" command should be followed by two large numbers (digits only).
Each letter or digit will create its own column or row in the pattern.
"random" command should be followed by two numbers, the first for the number of rows and the second for the number of columns.  
Ex:  
string hitome zashi  
number 31415926 8899645  
random 14 28
