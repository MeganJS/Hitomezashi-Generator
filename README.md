# Hitomezashi-Generator
A fun little c++ project that generates hitomezashi patterns randomly or based on input.
Commands: string, random, numbers.
If command string or command numbers is entered, it must be followed by two pieces of input for the vertical and horizontal axis of the hitomezashi pattern.
So far only runs in terminal. Thanks!
