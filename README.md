# Hitomezashi-Generator
A fun pattern-generating C++ project that generates hitomezashi patterns randomly or based on input.
Commands: string, random, numbers.
If command "string" or command "numbers" is entered, it must be followed by two pieces of input for the vertical and horizontal axis of the hitomezashi pattern.
Ex:
string hitome zashi
